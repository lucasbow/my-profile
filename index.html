              <h3> Who am I 🤔</h3>
               <p> I am Lucas, the funniest guy of band as my friends told me. I grew up in Paris, XVIII and went to Fenelon St Marie school. I have a very postif mindset which allows me never give up. I am driven by social interactions with my friends and football of course 🔵🔴. I have a team spirit which boosts the confidence of my team members. Thanks to my parents, I wen several times abroad for linguistic jouney (the USA, Canada...) </p>

            <div class="box-white" id="football">
               <h3> Football ⚽️ </h3>
               <p> For me football is much more than a sport, it is a state of mind. It is the most unifying experience that exists, whether in sport or otherwise. A cultural phenomenon in its own right that unites us in glory (<strong>1998 - 2018</strong>) and sometimes also in defeat...</p>

            <div class="box-white" id="trips">
               <h3>Linguistic trips build my cultural intelligence</h3>
               <p>Thanks to my parents, I was immersed in different ages, especially Anglo-Saxon but also Kabyle.Thanks to them I was able to go on 22 trips including the world, different behaviors, different ways of thinking could exist. Today it allows me to adapt my way of thinking, my outlook and my behavior on international events or in terms of my relations with foreigners. I went to : </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li> <strong>Toronto</strong>, Canada in 2017 competition for 5 years </li>
                     <li> <strong>San Antonion</strong> in Texas in 2018 </li>
                  </ul>
               <p> Thanks to them, I acknowledged a professionnal english.</p>

               <h3> My friends 🥳 </h3>
               <p>Social interactions shaped my behavior and who I am to this day. My friends make me grow every day, and I learn a lot of things about subjects that I'm not necessarily interested in. Subjective debates allow you to sharpen your critical spirit. I find that friends are important in life, almost as much as family.</p>
